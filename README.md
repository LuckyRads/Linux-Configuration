## What's this?

This repository contains all sorts of personal configuration scripts and installers.

## Contents

- <code>arch</code> contains Arch-based linux distro application installation scripts <b>(distro-dependant)</b>
- <code>debian</code> contains Debian-based linux distro application installation scripts <b>(distro-dependant)</b>
- <code>scripts</code> contains all sorts of configuration scripts for specific applications or application categories (non-platform dependant)

- <code>app-installers</code> contains application installation scripts, packages (to be) and other application files that can not be installed with regular package managers

## Disclaimer

If you plan to use these scripts - do it at your own risk. Some of these are not properly tested and may break your system or just downright not work.

## No discrimination

In case you're using Windows, there's also my personal <a href="https://github.com/LuckyRads/Windows-Configuration">Windows Configuration repository</a>. It does not contain any installation scripts, though.
